      > > for channel and chat owners â€” just add the bot as admin, select the price per month and withdraw crypto at any time; get a link to share with potential subscribers. For subscribers â€” go to the link, pay the membership fee, get invited by the bot to the private channel or group. The bot should kick people who didn't renew their membership.

      <summary>Detauls:</summary>

      > All the existing time tracker apps suck in some way. Make one that:
      > 
      > - Is easy to use
      > - Is highly automated
      > - Uses tags instead of categories (https://github.com/madhead/madhead.me/issues/6)
      > - Focuses on developers and engineers, with GitHub time-tracking being the priority
      >   - https://github.com/athul/waka-readme
      >   - but don't skimp on others
      > - Don't use subscription model for monetization. Single-time purchase model shows respect to users. At least the app must be:
      >   - Either cheap ($0.99/month max)
      >   - Or provide long (year+) subscription periods, still being rather cheap
